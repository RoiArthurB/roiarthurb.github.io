Here's a little list of scientific project I'm/been working on

## ESCAPE

:::info
**ESCAPE (Exploring by Simulation Cities Awareness on Population Evacuation)** aims to enhance large-scale evacuation planning for disaster management by integrating geographical information systems, agent-based modeling, and computer simulations. It focuses on creating realistic simulations for experimenting with evacuation strategies and considers factors like territorial information, demographics, and mobility, with a goal to provide measures for evacuation times and address collective behavioral challenges during crises.

:::info
**COMOKIT (CoVid19 Modeling Kit)** a modeling kit written in [GAMA](https://gama-platform.org) for analyzing and comparing interventions against the COVID-19 epidemic at the scale of a city.

It integrates various models, including individual clinical dynamics, infection transmission, environmental factors, policy design, and people's activities, to aid decision makers in addressing critical questions related to public health policies during the COVID-19 pandemic

:::info
The Project SIMPLE aims to create "sustainability metaverses" by integrating immersive virtual reality, serious games, and scientific simulations for education. It will also introduce the Mobile Metaverse Learning Lab (M2L2), offering a complete virtual reality environment for classrooms, even in areas with limited internet access. These virtual environments will be built upon validated scientific models, enabling real-time collaboration to address sustainability challenges.
